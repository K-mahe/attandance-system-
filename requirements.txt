Face Detection:

Time Complexity: O(N)
Explanation: The time complexity of face detection using algorithms like Haar cascades or Dlib's face detector is typically linear with respect to the number of pixels in the image (N). However, it can vary based on the implementation and the specific algorithm used.
Face Recognition:

Time Complexity: O(M * N)
Explanation: Face recognition involves comparing the facial features of detected faces with known faces stored in the database. The time complexity depends on the number of known faces (M) and the complexity of the comparison algorithm. If using Dlib's face recognition model, the complexity of comparing two feature vectors is usually linear (O(N)).
Attendance Logging:

Time Complexity: O(1)
Explanation: Logging attendance records typically involves simple database operations such as inserting records into a SQLite database. These operations have constant time complexity.
Web Interface:

Time Complexity: O(1)
Explanation: Serving web pages using Flask involves handling HTTP requests, rendering templates, and querying the database. These operations are generally efficient and have constant time complexity.
Overall Time Complexity:

The overall time complexity of the system depends on the most time-consuming component, which is usually face recognition.
If face recognition dominates the computational cost, the overall time complexity would be O(M * N), where M is the number of known faces and N is the number of pixels in the image.
However, it's essential to note that these are rough estimations, and the actual performance may vary based on factors such as hardware, optimization techniques, and the size of the dataset.
